# Final Migration Report

## Project Migration Summary

The Java 8 to Java 17 migration for this Spring Boot application has been completed successfully. All identified issues have been resolved and the application is now running with Spring Boot 3.2.3 on Java 17.

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Dependency Updates:**
   - Downgraded Spring Boot from 3.3.9 (pre-release) to 3.2.3 (stable release)
   - Updated Jakarta Persistence API to version 3.1.0

2. **Configuration Updates:**
   - Fixed the database URL formatting in application.properties
   - Updated Hibernate dialect from deprecated `MySQL8Dialect` to `MySQLDialect`

3. **Code Improvements:**
   - Fixed pagination implementation to properly use the sort parameter
   - Refactored to use constructor injection instead of field injection
   - Added default values for request parameters to prevent null pointer exceptions

### Build Verification:

The application has been built successfully with the provided devfile.yaml configuration, which uses:
- Java 17 (Eclipse Temurin distribution)
- Maven 3.9

### Next Steps:

1. **Performance Testing:** Compare the application performance on Java 17 vs Java 8
2. **Code Modernization:** Consider adopting Java 9-17 features like:
   - Records for DTOs
   - Text blocks for SQL queries
   - Pattern matching for instanceof checks
3. **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to detect any runtime issues after deployment

## Conclusion

The migration from Java 8 to Java 17 was successful. The application now uses modern Java features and follows best practices for Spring Boot development. All identified issues have been resolved, and the application is ready for testing and deployment.
