# Spring Boot Registration Application - Build Fix

## Problem Summary
The original project had build issues related to:
1. Mismatched versions between Hibernate and Spring Boot
2. EntityManagerFactory interface conflict with Spring's EntityManagerFactoryInfo mixin

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Explicit Version Management
The root cause of the build issues was explicit version management in the pom.xml file which was forcing incompatible dependency versions:

```xml
<!-- REMOVED THIS SECTION -->
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>jakarta.persistence</groupId>
            <artifactId>jakarta.persistence-api</artifactId>
            <version>3.2.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

This explicit version (3.2.0) of jakarta.persistence-api was incompatible with the Hibernate version used by Spring Boot 3.3.9, causing version conflicts.

### 2. Removed Direct Dependency on Jakarta Persistence API
The project also had a direct dependency on jakarta.persistence-api:

```xml
<!-- REMOVED THIS DEPENDENCY -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.persistence</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.persistence-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

By removing this, we allow Spring Boot's dependency management to handle the correct compatible versions of all JPA-related dependencies.

### 3. Why This Fixes the Issues
- **Version Mismatch**: Spring Boot 3.3.9 dependency management now controls all dependency versions, ensuring they're all compatible.
- **EntityManagerFactory Interface Conflict**: The conflict happened because the explicitly defined jakarta.persistence-api 3.2.0 had interfaces that were incompatible with Hibernate's implementation used by Spring Boot. By removing it, Spring Boot provides a consistent set of JPA/Hibernate dependencies that work together.

## How to Build the Project
A devfile has been created for consistent builds:

1. To build the project:
   ```
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

2. To run the application:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Technical Details
- Spring Boot version: 3.3.9
- Java version: 17
- Build system: Maven

By letting Spring Boot's dependency management handle the versions, we avoid the complex dependency conflicts that were causing the build failures.
