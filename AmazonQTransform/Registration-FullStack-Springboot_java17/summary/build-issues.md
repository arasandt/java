# Build Issues Analysis

Based on the project code review, here are potential build issues when migrating from Java 8 to Java 17:

## 1. Spring Boot and Dependencies

- Current Spring Boot version: 3.2.3 (stable release)
- Java version configured: Java 17 (compatible)

## 2. Potential Issues

### Hibernate Dialect Configuration
- The application is using `org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect` which is deprecated in newer Hibernate versions
- Should be updated to `org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect`

### Application Properties
- Database connection properties are hardcoded with local credentials
- Contains commented-out alternative configuration which might cause confusion

### Dependency Versions
- Need to verify all dependency versions are compatible with Spring Boot 3.2.x
- Especially focus on:
  - Jakarta Persistence API compatibility
  - MySQL connector version compatibility

## 3. Next Steps

1. Update Hibernate dialect in application.properties
2. Check for deprecated method calls in service implementations
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly configured and up to date
4. Run a build to identify other potential issues
