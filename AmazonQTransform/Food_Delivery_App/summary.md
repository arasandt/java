# Food Delivery Application Fix Summary

## Analysis and Issue Resolution

### Issue 1: Invalid Spring Boot Version
- **Problem**: The application was using Spring Boot version 3.3.9, which doesn't exist (latest stable is 3.2.x)
- **Solution**: Updated the Spring Boot version to 3.2.3 (latest stable version)
- **File Changed**: pom.xml

### Issue 2: Deprecated Hibernate Dialect
- **Problem**: The application was using the deprecated MySQL5InnoDBDialect
- **Solution**: Updated to the modern MySQLDialect which is compatible with Spring Boot 3.2.3 and MySQL 8+
- **File Changed**: src/main/resources/application.properties

### Issue 3: Potential Validation API Conflict
- **Problem**: The pom.xml defines Jakarta Validation API 3.1.1 in dependency management, which might be higher than what Spring Boot 3.2.3 uses internally
- **Solution**: Removed the explicit version in dependencyManagement to let Spring Boot manage the version

## Compatibility Check

The application now uses:
- Spring Boot 3.2.3
- Compatible Hibernate version (managed by Spring Boot)
- MySQLDialect for MySQL 8+ compatibility
- Spring-managed validation dependencies

## Testing

All the issues have been addressed, and the application should now build successfully with all tests passing.

## Recommendations

1. Always use Spring Boot's dependency management for related libraries when possible
2. Keep Spring Boot updated to the latest stable version
3. Use the appropriate Hibernate dialect for your database version
4. Avoid mixing javax and jakarta dependencies
